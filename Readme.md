### Computer vision based system to track the ball. 

## Computer Vision Tasks Used:

- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8
- **Object Segmentation**: SAM
- **Object Tracking**: XMem, RAFT, Dense Optical Flow, Stereo Optical Flow, UniMatch


# **Results:**

## 1. Object Tracking

---

### **Dense Optical Flow:**

Dense optical flow is a computer vision technique that computes the motion vectors of every pixel in a pair of consecutive frames of a video sequence. The motion vectors provide information on how objects in the scene are moving between frames, which can be used for tasks such as object tracking, scene analysis, and video stabilization. Dense optical flow is widely used in applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and video editing.

## 3. Object Detection:
This section of the code was utilized solely for the purpose of detecting the ball in the first frame, as implemented by Tamas.
